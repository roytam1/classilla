Classilla modifications to zlib 1.2.3 for Mac OS:

enum changed to ZLENS and ZCODES for clashing defs
typedefs added back to zutil.h
#define SLOW (sigh)

This was disgusting and I am ashamed of myself. Please do not judge my worth as
a programmer based on what you see in this directory.

Cameron Kaiser, disgusting hacker
